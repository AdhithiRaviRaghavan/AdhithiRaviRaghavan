# Hi, I'm Adhithi!

Iâ€™m a PhD-trained scientist with a background in genome biology and computational analysis, driven by a curiosity to understand complex biological systems and a commitment to building tools and insights that support research and health innovation.

### About Me

**What Iâ€™ve done:**  
I study the mechanisms of **genome instability** and **chromatin remodeling** using integrative analysis of **next-generation sequencing** data â€” including **ChIP-seq**, **RNA-seq**, **MNase-seq**, and **TrAEL-seq**. My research has centered on **repetitive and telomeric regions**, where Iâ€™ve built **reproducible pipelines** and combined experimental data with computational tools to uncover how genome architecture influences function and repair.

**What Iâ€™m looking for:**  
Iâ€™m excited to bring this experience into **translational genomics**, **multi-omics integration**, and **computational discovery** in health and disease. Iâ€™m especially drawn to roles where I can contribute to **biomedical insight**, **diagnostic innovation**, or **therapeutic development** by working at the intersection of data science and biology.
