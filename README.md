### What I Do

🧬 Analyze genome structure, repetitive DNA, and chromatin states  
📊 Build scalable pipelines for NGS data (ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, MNase-seq, TrAEL-seq)  
🛠 Develop tools in R, Python, and Bash, run on HPC clusters  
🔎 Extract biological insights from complex genomic regions  
🧪 Collaborate across wet and dry labs to drive discovery

###  About Me

**What I’ve done:**  
I study the mechanisms of genome instability and chromatin remodeling using integrative analysis of **next-generation sequencing** data — including **ChIP-seq**, **RNA-seq**, **MNase-seq**, and **TrAEL-seq**. My research has centered on **repetitive and telomeric regions**, where I’ve built **reproducible pipelines** and combined experimental data with computational tools to uncover how genome architecture influences function and repair.

**What I’m looking for:**  
I’m excited to bring this experience into **translational genomics**, **multi-omics integration**, and **computational discovery** in health and disease. I’m especially drawn to roles where I can contribute to **biomedical insight**, **diagnostic innovation**, or **therapeutic development** by working at the intersection of data science and biology.
