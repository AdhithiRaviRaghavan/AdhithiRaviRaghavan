# 👋 Hi, I'm Adhithi!

![Typing SVG](https://readme-typing-svg.demolab.com?font=Fira+Code&pause=900&color=4DC0D6&width=700&lines=Computational+Biologist+%7C+PhD+in+Genome+Biology;R%2C+Python%2C+HPC+Specialist+for+NGS+Data;Genome+Stability+%7C+Chromatin+%7C+Multi-Omics+Integration;Open+to+Roles+in+Genomics%2C+Biotech%2C+Health+Data)

I’m a PhD-trained scientist with a background in genome biology and computational analysis, driven by a curiosity to understand complex biological systems and a commitment to building tools and insights that support research and health innovation.

### 🧠 What I Do

🧬 Analyze genome structure, repetitive DNA, and chromatin states  
📊 Build scalable pipelines for NGS data (ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, MNase-seq, TrAEL-seq)  
🛠 Develop tools in R, Python, and Bash, run on HPC clusters  
🔎 Extract biological insights from complex genomic regions  
🧪 Collaborate across wet and dry labs to drive discovery

### 🔬 About Me

**What I’ve done:**  
I study the mechanisms of **genome instability** and **chromatin remodeling** using integrative analysis of **next-generation sequencing** data — including **ChIP-seq**, **RNA-seq**, **MNase-seq**, and **TrAEL-seq**. My research has centered on **repetitive and telomeric regions**, where I’ve built **reproducible pipelines** and combined experimental data with computational tools to uncover how genome architecture influences function and repair.

**What I’m looking for:**  
I’m excited to bring this experience into **translational genomics**, **multi-omics integration**, and **computational discovery** in health and disease. I’m especially drawn to roles where I can contribute to **biomedical insight**, **diagnostic innovation**, or **therapeutic development** by working at the intersection of data science and biology.
